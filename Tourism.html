    <h1>Tourism</h1><br>
    <p>Welcome to the Tourism page where you will be viewing all the Tourist attratcions in Egypt</p><br>
    <br>
    <p>Egypt is a large region crossing the northeast corner of Africa and the southwest corner of Asia via a land bridge established by the Sinai Peninsula.<br>The Mediterranean Sea, the Gaza Strip of Palestine and Israel, the Red Sea, Sudan, and Libya form its northern, eastern, southern, and western borders, respectively. Egypt is separated from Jordan and Saudi Arabia in the northeast by the Gulf of Aqaba.<br>Egypt's capital and largest city is Cairo, but Alexandria, the Mediterranean coast's second-largest city, is a significant industrial and tourism centre.<br>
        With nearly 100 million residents, Egypt is the 14th-most populous country in the world.<br>
    <br>Due to its heavy reliance on dishes made with legumes and vegetables, Egyptian cuisine is especially suited to vegetarian diets.<br>Egyptian cuisine is primarily based on foods that spring from the ground, with the exception of Alexandria and the coast of Egypt, where fish and other seafood are routinely used.<br>Due to the high cost of meat for the majority of Egyptians throughout history, a wide variety of vegetarian dishes have been created.
    The rice, lentil, and macaroni dish known as kushari is regarded by some as the national dish.<br>Kushari can also include fried onions.<br>
    <br>The structures in the Nile Valley, which have stood for millennia, are popular tourist destinations. The Pyramids and Great Sphinx at Giza, the Abu Simbel temples south of Aswan, and the Karnak Temple Complex and Valley of the Kings close to Luxor are the most notable among them.<br> 
    The Cairo Museum and the Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha are two Cairo attractions.
    <br>In addition to Hurghada City on the Red Sea coast and the renowned El Gouna Resort, the Sinai Peninsula shoreline offers popular beach resorts, 25 km Hurghada. People all over the world come to visit these places mostly because of the history they all hold.
